# Machine-learned-ranking

This repository contains the Code developed for a project part of the course CS260: Machine Learning Algorithms at UCLA. 
You can access the project report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3Ls838sEXFocFk5b0dERWFFTDQ/view?usp=sharing)

The folder are named as per the following conventions:

1. Featurize: Code files here were used to featurize the set of documents and queries to other feature spaces. Feature spaces converted to are LDA, LSI and Tf-idf. Also, the files check.py was used to computer ndcg scores for the queries.
2. Supervised: Contains the code for supervised approaches.
3. test_place: Contains the code files for converting raw data to pickle files.

The code base is not commented as such, and also is developed on the assumption that certain data folders are present, which are not present here. In case you would want to run these code files, shoot me an e-mail, and I would see that you are able to get things up and running

Thanks
